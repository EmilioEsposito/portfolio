This repo has a NextJS frontend and a FastAPI backend. It also has an Expo app but not really using it much, it is not a priority right now.

See README.md for more context.

See .vscode/launch.json for how to run the different services (again, we can ignore the Expo app for now).

See .codex/setup.sh for how your development environment was setup in case you suspect something is wrong with your environment.
