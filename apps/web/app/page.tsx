          This platform has some technical projects that I do for fun/learning,
          but also hosts production apps used for Sernia Capital's in-house
          property managment operations. Sernia Capital is a residential real
          estate business that uses AI and automation to streamline various
          aspects of property mangagement, including tenant communications,
          maintenance requests, and general operations.

          <br />
          This monitors every incoming SMS text message sent to our business phone number 
          recieves, and escalates to property managers and owners as needed for 
          things that require URGENT action (e.g. water leaks, fire, police activity, etc.). 
          We use OpenPhone to host our business phone number, and they send a Webhook for every incoming message.
          Then, our AI instantly analyzes if the message is urgent, and if so, uses Twilio to kickoff a series of 
          calls/texts to the property managers and owners using a dedicated emergency number that 
          can bypass Do Not Disturb settings during off hours.

          Simple app to send SMS messages to all tenants in selected buildings.
          OpenPhone doesn't support sending to groups, so this app uses their
          API to achieve this. Messages are sent securely with password
          protection.

          This app auto-responds to inbound leasing inquiries from our Zillow
          ads. It will have context on all our properties via RAG, current
          rental listings (via Zillow API or scraping), as well as our listing
          agent's calendar availability & scheduling preferences. It will
          monitor our Gmail Workspace inbox for new inquiries, and will answer
          basic questions, will scan requestors Zillow profile and clarify any
          potential issues (e.g. if they have dogs but our listing is dog-free),
          and propose meeting times.

        <P>
          The plan is to build a fully agentic chatbot for Sernia Capital that will have ability to 
          manage our tasks on Trello, read and send emails/push/sms, and more. On the backend, it will use tool/function
          calling to execute any of our internal services on the FastAPI server. It will even have access to 
          APScheduler, which will allow the chatbot to schedule of our internal services and initiate chats 
          with any property managers or owners (e.g. it can ping them to make sure a remodeling project is on track).
