This is a repo for me to put various projects and tools in. I like to keep things simple and clean. 

## Tech Stack:
* Frontend: Next.js - 
    * UI: [Shadcn UI](mdc:https:/ui.shadcn.com/docs) & Tailwind CSS
* Backend: [FastAPI](mdc:https:/fastapi.tiangolo.com) - contained under `/api/` directory & deployed as a Serverless Function on Vercel
    * Database: [Neon Postgres](mdc:https:/neon.tech)
* Deployment: [Vercel](mdc:https:/vercel.com) 
* Package Managers: pnpm and pip

# General Rules:
- Feel free to make suggestions on stylistic improvements if current patterns could be significantly improved/simplified; otherwise stick to the current patterns.
- Do not remove my comments. They are there for my benefit. You can suggest edits to them if they are wrong. 
- I hate CSS. I have no desire to learn it. Keep styling simple and clean. 
- Keep credentialing simple. I am a solo developer and don't need separate credentials for each microservice. 
- Do NOT remove functionality (e.g. remove an API route import) without asking me first. 
- Only suggest code that is safe to deploy to main branch and production. Nothing that would require code to change on diff environments.
- For imports, use absolute paths and avoid relative imports if possible. It makes refactoring easier.
- The new way to install Shadcn UI is `pnpm dlx @shadcn/ui@latest add add <component>`. Old way gives errors.
- Do not make unrelated changes to the task at hand without asking me first.
