# AI SDK Python Streaming Preview

This template demonstrates the usage of [Data Stream Protocol](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/ai-sdk-ui/stream-protocol#data-stream-protocol) to stream chat completions from a Python endpoint ([FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com)) and display them using the [useChat](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/ai-sdk-ui/chatbot#chatbot) hook in your Next.js application.

To run the example locally you need to:

# Setup

0. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/EmilioEsposito/portfolio.git`
1. Sign up for accounts with the AI providers you want to use (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic).
2. Obtain API keys for each provider.
3. Set the required environment variables as shown in the `.env.example` file, but in a new file called `.env`.
4. `pnpm install` to install the required Node dependencies.
5. `virtualenv venv` to create a virtual environment.
6. `source venv/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment.
7. `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required Python dependencies.
8. `pnpm dev` to launch the development server.
